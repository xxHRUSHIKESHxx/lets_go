      <h1>Happy Birthday To The Love Of My Life ❤️</h1>
      <p>
        As the clock ticks past midnight, I find myself staring at the screen,
        my fingers hovering over the keyboard. "Happy Birthday," I type, each
        letter a silent prayer, a whisper of longing that stretches across the
        miles between us. It hurts, knowing that I can't be there to see the
        smile on your face, to feel the warmth of your hand in mine as you make
        a wish. But in these words, in this message, I'm pouring all of my
        hopes, all of my dreams of a future where we'll celebrate together. I
        may not be there today, but I promise you, with every beat of my heart,
        that I'll make it up to you. One day soon, we'll blow out those candles
        together, and our love will shine brighter than any distance could ever
        dim. Happy Birthday, my love.
      </p>

      <h2>6+ Years Together</h2>
      <p class="poem">
        Six years have passed, my love, since our journey began,<br>
        Through highs and lows, hand in hand, we've bravely ran.<br>
        With every sunrise and each twilight's gentle hue,<br>
        I pray our love remains steadfast, forever true.<br><br>
        
        As seasons change and time dances its endless waltz,<br>
        I find solace in the warmth of your loving pulse.<br>
        Together we've weathered storms, our bond only grew strong,<br>
        In your arms, my dear, is where I truly belong.<br><br>
        
        So here's to us, to six years of laughter and tears,<br>
        To countless memories that have shaped our years.<br>
        And as we look ahead, to the chapters yet to write,<br>
        I dream of the day our souls reunite.<br><br>
        
        For in the next time we meet, my heart skips with glee,<br>
        I'll gather courage, my love, and ask upon bended knee,<br>
        For a simple date, a moment just for us to share,<br>
        To celebrate the love we've built, beyond compare.
      </p>
